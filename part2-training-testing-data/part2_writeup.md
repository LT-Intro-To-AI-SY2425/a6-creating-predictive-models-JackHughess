# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?

This model lets you know the inaccuracies of the data because it tells you to account for the variance in the data, while in the last model you wouldn't know if the model is accurate or not for actual data.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?

It tells you how far away the data is on average, favoring higher differences more. This is a pretty low value with .6 so I wouldn't trust this model very much.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.

I think that my model is more for an estimate, not to acutally predict real data with accuracy.
