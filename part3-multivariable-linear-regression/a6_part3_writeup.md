# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?

This coeffecient is .86 which is pretty decent. This means that the square of the error is not that far because .86 is pretty high.

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?

My model is pretty accurate, but it is not super reliable because some of the things are far away from the actual answer if you actually needed precise data.

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?

9191.94539359 and 2100.5206231

4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?

if it is a linear model and the slope is negative, eventually cars with very high values will dip below the x axis at higher values.
